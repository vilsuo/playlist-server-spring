Odin - the god of nocturnal storms<br />
ranged the sky with his horse<br />
deciding man's fate<br />
<br />
When there was a battle on earth<br />
Odin sent his valkyries<br />
to mingle with the combatants and determine<br />
which warriors should fall<br />
<br />
And they awarded - victory and glory<br />
to those combatants - who won their favour<br />
After the bloodbath - they returned to Valhalla<br />
announced to Odin - those who would join the troop<br />
<br />
In the splendour of his holyness - he rarely appeared<br />
but in a disguise - he travelled the world<br />
creating warriors - so strong and glorious<br />
from ordinary men<br />
grew up so splendid heroes<br />
<br />
Heroes in godly blaze<br />
<br />
He knew the spells - which cured the illness<br />
magic formulas - which broke the chains<br />
Those which rendered - weapons so powerless<br />
dead could speak, waves could rose<br />
- by his magic spells
